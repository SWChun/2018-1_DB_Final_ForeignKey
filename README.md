Our database schema is saved in test.sql

Our program is web-based program, so you do not need to install anything for testing.
Just visit the following URL, and you will see our running program.<br>
http://119.202.32.238/db/2018-1_DB_Final_ForeignKey/index.html<br>
In case the website is not visitable because I have turn off the server computer, contact one of our team member, please.<br>

If you want to test the program with with local database, you must do the following two things:<br>

<ul>
  <li>import test.sql file to build a new database in you mySQL
  <li>change the login information inside dbconfig.php.
</ul>
For example, the password is current set as the password to login into our own database, so you must change this to your own in order to test this program running on your own database.
